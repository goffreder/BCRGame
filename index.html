    This is an HTML5 porting of the famous Flash game <a href="http://chainrxn.zwigglers.com/" target="_blank">Chain RXN</a>.<br>
    It uses an HTML5 Canvas element and the well-known JavaScript framework <a href="http://kineticjs.com/" target="_blank">Kinetic.js</a>.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
    In this version you don't have to explode as many shperes as possible. Instead, you have to build a chain as deep as possible.<br>
    The levels are cleared upon reaching a determinate grade of reaction.
    For example, the third level is cleared by reaching grade 8. It means that at least one sphere must react with a grade 4 sphere,
    which is a sphere that has reacted with a grade 2 sphere (the starting grade).<br>
    Currently there are 12 levels, the last one is passed by reaching grade 16777216 (or 2^24).
    </p>
    <p>
    The Start buttons starts the game.
    The UseRadius and UseTime are examples of power ups. The former doubles the explosion radius,
    the latter doubles the time the explosion is visible.
